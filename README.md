# farmbot-pesu
My project as an intern at CIOT-PESU (July to October 2021) to automate agriculture and household farming. 
This repository contains only the resources of my electronics domain.
The drafts in this repository are versions of the farmbot Arduino code as the project progressed through various test phases, requirement additions, and modifications.
